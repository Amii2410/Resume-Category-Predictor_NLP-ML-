# Resume-Classifier-NLP-ML

Resume Classifier -- NLP & Machine Learning
This project is a Resume Classification System that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning algorithms to automatically sort resumes into specific job categories.

The system takes raw text resumes, cleans them, extracts features with TF-IDF Vectorization, and uses classification models to predict the category of each resume.

Features:-

Cleans and preprocesses raw resume text

Extract useful features using NLP techniques

Trains classification models to predict job categories

Provides evaluation metrics for model performance

Tech Stack

Python for implementation

scikit-learn for machine learning models

pandas, numpy for data handling

NLTK / spaCy for text processing
